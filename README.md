# Random Scripts
This project contains rules I used for clash, Quantumult X, and Surge(Mostly), feel free to use it.
Most of the script is modified from other open sourced projects, modified to fit Surge's DOMAIN-SET and Clash.😄
Sample configs are included, but it is best to use your own configuration

# ℹ️ Surge file instructions
There are three kinds of rule list, one for ads blocking, one for privacy protection, and one for setting correct route for chinese websites. 

### RULE-SET & DOMAIN-SET

According to [Surge's official guidance](https://manual.nssurge.com/book/understanding-surge/en/#rule-system)

> 4.3.5.1 Difference between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET

> RULE-SET can contain all types of sub-rules, with no difference in execution efficiency from the rules in the main configuration, while DOMAIN-SET can only use both DOMAIN and DOMAIN-SUFFIX forms of content, using special logic optimized to provide a huge performance boost when there is very much content. (over a thousand items, otherwise there is not much difference between the two)

- CN-IP-SET.list
  This is not for production use, just for testing.

- China-Site.list
  adopted from https://github.com/Hackl0us/SS-Rule-Snippet

- Non-China-Site.list
