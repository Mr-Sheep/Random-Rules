# Random Scripts
This project contains rules I used for clash and Surge, feel free to use it.
Part of this project is based on [NobyDa/Script](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/), which has awesome rules and scripts for Surge & QuantumultX, however, it does not support clash.

## File related instructions
### Basic.list (Clash ONLY)
Scripts from multiple projects, some may duplicate AdRule

### AdRule.list
More than 8000 ad rules， integrate lhie1 and ConnersHua and added some advertising rules

### AdRule-IP-CIDR.list 
IP-CIDR part from AdRule.list to better fit Surge's [DOMAIN-SET feature](#Difference between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET)

### AdRuleTest.list 
More than 1300 ad rules，This rule is modified from Scomper. Because the original author stopped maintenance, so take over the optimization and delete some normal rules, only for testing

### Download.list 
Integrate some BT, Thunder, download shunt rules

### MayCrash.list
This part of the rule is modified from github.com/StevenBlack/hosts, with over 70k+ rules, originally a hosts file, so it may CRASH on surge, created for testing purposes only
**May Crash due to iOS NE memory limit**

### ChineseWebsite.list
This list is a modification of https://github.com/vokins/yhosts, with over 8k+ rules
**May Crash due to iOS NE memory limit**

Also consider adding [RewriteRules.sgmodule](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/blob/master/Surge/Module/RewriteRules.sgmodule) for better ad filtering.

## Difference between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET
According to [Surge's official guidance](https://manual.nssurge.com/book/understanding-surge/en/#rule-system)

> 4.3.5.1 Difference between RULE-SET and DOMAIN-SET

> RULE-SET can contain all types of sub-rules, with no difference in execution efficiency from the rules in the main configuration, while DOMAIN-SET can only use both DOMAIN and DOMAIN-SUFFIX forms of content, using special logic optimized to provide a huge performance boost when there is very much content. (over a thousand items, otherwise there is not much difference between the two)
